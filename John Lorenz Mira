## Best Practices Implementation

### 1. Environment Variables
**Why did we put `BASE_URI` in `.env` instead of hardcoding it?**

Answer:  
Placing `BASE_URI` in an environment file helps keep the code clean and secure. It allows us to update the base URL easily without touching the source code and avoids exposing important configuration details when the project is uploaded to a public repository.

### 2. Resource Modeling
**Why do we use plural nouns (e.g., `/dishes`) for our routes?**

Answer:  
Plural route names are used because they represent a group or collection of resources. This follows RESTful standards and makes the API easier to understand, organize, and expand in the future.

### 3. Status Codes
**When do we use `201 Created` vs `200 OK`?**

Answer:  
`201 Created` is returned when a new resource is successfully added to the system, such as after a POST request. `200 OK` is used when a request is successful but does not create new data, like fetching or updating existing information.

**Why is it important to return `404` instead of an empty array or generic error?**

Answer:  
Using `404 Not Found` clearly tells the client that the requested data does not exist. This makes error handling clearer and helps developers quickly understand what went wrong instead of guessing from unclear responses.
